# PNGSplit
## What is this?

 _Improved description:_ The Toontown Spoofer (created by The Spoof Net in late 2012) had a plethora of useful tools intended to aide users in creating texture modifications to Disney's Toontown Online (before the game closed in 2013)

_Original description:_ Simple tool to convert transparency alpha channels into RGB channels. Inspired by TheSpoofNet's PNG split tool on The Toontown Spoofer!

Currently, the algorithm is fully coded in Java, and will later be converted into Python and psuedo-code in the future. There is no working demo of this feature as of right now, but you could experiment with an unstable, user-unfriendly version by checking out the "cli" branch.

## Future Plans

In the near future, I will rework a lot of the contents listed in this repository and improve the reading/programming functionality.
